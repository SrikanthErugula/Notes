Remote state
==============
--> state is used by terraform. usually we should not touch state file. 

--> We should secure state file from accidental changes.  --> it means unfortunately keys press avavtum and delete avvatum with our interruption  .  

1st person completed infra, state is in his local.. ---> state file anedhi 1st person laptop lone vunttadhi,
2nd person want to do changes, so here 1st person emi chesadu ani 2nd person ki teliyadhu so in this case, he initialise terraform, he will plan and he will apply

so here mainly 2 thigs will happen
=================================
1. either duplicate resources will be created
2. error while creating resources or else we will get error like saying that already exists

--> so ec2 instaces enni ayina create cheyachu, but sg matram same vunte manaki error vastundhi like already exist ani
---> what is the solution while mutliple person work chestunte
--> here we have dig state.drwio..

we must keep state file in remote location while working in collaboration environment for security and preventing duplicate resources and errors when multiple members( team members) are working together

--> state file should be locked when terraform is doing something, so that other person can't apply the changes.

--> everytool ki oka starage vunttadhi like aws ki s3 ani azure ki someedho... emi lekapothe terraform own ga storage create chestundhi..
--> drive lo manam ela folder create chetamo ala aws lo s3 bucket create cheyali.. for starage purpose our state file....
--> here entire aws s3 bucket name should be unique ga vundali...
--> dsoaws-remote-state --> s3 bucket create chesam next aa file location or path access terraform ki ichhi state files ni akkada store chesuko ani cheppali...

terrform aws s3 remote starge ---> https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/s3 --> here we will get backen code for state file storing

locals
=======
locals are like variables but it has many extra capabilities
1. variables can be overriden, locals can't be overriden
2. you can use variables inside locals. but we can't use one variable in another variable
3. you can store expressions or functions inside locals block and reuse them whenever required

Provisoners
=============
terraform is creating instance, if we want to configure terraform is allowing to run few scripts

1. local-exec
2. remote-exec
