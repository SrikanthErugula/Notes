							FINAL NOTES FOR TERRAFORM
							==========================

							  SES-29-c1
						   *****************
**Use Terraform for better  infra creation. Once servers are created by Terraform, then hand over them to Ansible, so here Ansible completes the configuration in the server**
--->  Terraform can manage or owner of the server infrastructure

Terraform -> IaaC ( Infrastructure as a code )

CM -> Configuration as a code

---> So why do we write code? bcz manual ga one server loki login  ayyi emi emi configuration and properties vunnnai chudandi ante chala kastum and time consumed, so adhe code laga rasukunte it will be easy to track everything in that server....

---> CRUD operations ni easy ga perform cheyachhu in code 
--> so code lo ithe eas ga CRUD operations cheyachuu
--> so finally infra kuda consistency laga vundali.
Inventory -> ikkada chuste manaki easy ga telustundhi  
Cost optimisation ---->
Time saving and no human errors
Dependency -> SG, EC2 and then R53 

Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, etc..  all are the same, but based on the latest version we can use here

HCL -> HashiCorp Configuration Language .. terraform introduced this company

--> terraform anedhi server run cheyamu ( it doesn't work within server) 
--> terraform ni use chesi rasina code tho aws lo server ni create cheyachu that is infrasture so aws ni connect or access cheyanlante we need to install terraform in our windows

-> in terraform everything is key value based like key = somevalue.....
--> terraform always follow this syntax...as below
resource "type_of_resource" "name-of-resource"
 {
	
	key = value
	
}
---> provider.tf --- so here manam cheptunam dheniki connect avvali ani, its mandatory for terraform

---> Terraform commands will have been worked at .tf folder only
1. terraform init -> downloads the provider, intialise terraform
2. terraform plan -> It will give us a plan that what it is going to do
3. terraform apply -> creates the infra as given in the plan

terraform apply -auto-approve --> if u provide like these it doesn't ask any permission like yes so its automatically procced 

terraform destroy -auto-approve  It means all data will be destroyed, sg and instance all

-->Ingress ( Data in )means entrance, or the right to enter, or the act of entering

--> Egress (Data Out)
Definition: Data leaving a network or system (e.g., downloading from the cloud, sending emails).

OVER VIEW
=================================================================================

1. installed terraform, setup the env variable in system path
2. aws cli v2 install
3. aws configure

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy

--> the syntax we called as HCL 
The HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) syntax is designed to be human-readable and machine-friendly, built primarily around arguments, blocks, and expressions. It is used in HashiCorp products like Terraform, Nomad, and Packer. 

resource "type_of_resource" "resource_name_our_wish" {
	key = "value"
}


		=====================================================================
							  SES-30-c2
						   *****************
git -> repository to store only code. here max 50 MB varaku store cheyali ani restrict chesaru
.gitignore means konni files ni ignore chei ani cheptundhi andhulo vunttai emi emi ignore cheyalo..

rm -rf .git
add .gitignore
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <URL>
git add . ; git commit ; git push

$ git add . ; git commit -m "terraform_start" ; git push origin main -f  ( so here -f used to for force push ) 

variables
========= DRY ===
Syntax is
---------
variable "variable_name" {
	default = "value-of-variable"
}

ex:- var.ami_id and var.instance_type  like this u can refer in ec2.tf lo 

--> data types means int,string,boolean,number....float
preference topic
===========
1. command line variable values have first preference
syntax: terraform plan -var='instance_type=t2.micro'

2. terraform.tfvars
syntax:: terraform plan -var-file='my-vars.tfvars'   ---> another model ---> 

3. env variable TF_VAR_<variable_name>

synrtax::;  export TF_VAR_instance_type="t3.reddy"
unset TF_VAR_instance_type ----> ila ivvatum valla adhi remove avuthundi ---> default state ki vastundhi

4. default value so  emiana vundha ani..

So actually ga user ni adugutham value ni provide chayamani, vallaki teliyali ga
so manaki readability kosam manam type anedhi use chestam, like string or map or list or number ani...........

5. finally prompt  --> it means manam value ni enter cheyali 
conditions
==============
in terraform syntax is:
------------------------
expression ? "this will run if true" : "this will run if false"

EX : instance_type = var.environment == "dev" ? "t3.micro" : "t3.medium"

count based loop
================
count = length(var.instances) or else count = 10
count.index -> special variable --> terraform has given like this 
So basically index starts from 0 

so this called count based usually works with list items.....

-->if in case u wrote all tf files in single folder terraform will start the execution alphabetical order...abcde...
interpolation
============
concatenating variable and other content--> it means add 2 variables


OVER VIEW
=================================================================================

Variables:-
=============
variable "var_name" {
	default = "default_value"
}

--> SO inka varibales like as below laga kuda declare cheyachu

1. Through command line
2. terraform.tfvars
3. ENV variable TF_VAR_var_name
4. default value
5. prompt it means it is asking pls enter like that

var.var_name --> ila code lo variables ni declare cheyachu

"${var.var_name}" --> ila ekkuva vars ni declare cheyalante process like this

types of variables
================
number
string
list
map
bool

Condition:-
==============
expression ? "true" : "false"

loops
======
count based loop -> it is used to get list iteration, here aa process lo manaki count.index ani vastundi

count = number

count.index --> so ikkasa loop ayina everytime manaki ila oka special variables istundhi   ---------------> these all are learn by class 30 
==============
resource "aws_instance" "terraform" {} --> so ikkada ee block varaku output kavalante u need to ask like these ..so ala dhenikaina kuda we can get........

output "instances_output" 
{
#   value = aws_instance.terraform # so idhi ec2.tf lo name vuntthdi so akkada numchi tisukovali
# }
		=====================================================================
							  SES-31-c3
						   *****************
for loop --> we are using it, in set or map situation lo use chestam...
for_each = toset(["bucket-alpha", "bucket-beta", "bucket-gamma"])  --> so ikkada map ki matrame chestam, don't use it in at count 

list -> string values --> in this situation we need to use count-based
map -> key and values  --> in this situation we need to use for-loops

I want to iterate list through for_each then here u have to convert into toset
---> so map details levvu anukunte list deatails ni map loki convert cheyalante we need toset syntax appudu list nuchi map convert ayyi key = value avuthundhi

Syntax is: 
=========
for_each = toset(list) 
---> here list convert into set or map ---> after done iteration we will get each.value.... in this toset both are same like each.key or each.value

count -> list -> count.index
for_each -> map -> each.key and each.value


data sources
==============
---> in aws after created servers or instances, values ni query or pickup chesukovatame data sources...
---> sources means we can query the existing information in the provider using data sources.

Syntax is: 
=========
data "aws_ami" "joindevops" {  ---> "aws_ami" here edhi ithe query cheyalanukuntunaro aa name ivvali..  "joindevops" this name is our choice
	parameters to query
}

--> so here evaru ithe ami id create chesi push chestaro  Valle owner avutharu ---> very IMP topic projects lo baga use chestaru ......
---->So finally manual ga ayina or terraform tho ayina create chesina server lo numchi manam akkada vuna data ni qury cheyachu means bayatiki tisukoni save chesukovachhu

functions : it means take i/p and give o/p
============
EX 1
-----
> join("_",["Srikanth","Reddy","Erugula"])
"Srikanth_Reddy_Erugula"

EX 2 : give like this max(5, 12, 9)

merge function

--->merge({a="b", c="d"}, {e="f", c="z"})
          ({map1}       , { map2})
--> Finally map1 and map2 iste.. always map2 anedhi map1 vunna contenct replace cheyadaki chustadi..

result:-
=====
a = b
c = z
e = f

--->The Terraform merge function combines multiple maps or objects into a single map or object.
--> Finally map1 and map2 iste.. always map2 anedhi map1 vunna contenct replace cheyadaki chustadi..



state
=========
Terraform responsibility is whatever we give in .tf files, it should create those resources ->is called declarative way of creating infra( so here manam cheptunam naaku idhi kavali ani nuvvu ichina syntx follow avvuthu rasi istunam) 

--> A "declarative way" means describing what you want as a result, not how to get it

matching you declared infra with actual infra in AWS account

--> Terraform responsibility is   manam ichhina desired infra tho actual infra ni match cheyatum.... so then state file tho comparison chesukoni then will start re create if not present

What is terraform state
=====================
terraform state is used to match the desired infra with actual infra, when create read update and delete the infra terraform uses this state file to achieve the desired infra for comparison. It is like memory to terraform

---> terraform locks the state file when terraform is running......>it means terraform apply ni run chestunte, so there tfstate file ni terraform lock chestundi, evvaru kuda disturb cheyakunda.>   process anthe run tharvatha unlock chestundi..appudu manaki visible avuthundi..

--> so finaly state file anedhi terraform kosame vundi, adhe CRUD operation chesukoni adhe manage chesukunttadhi so terraform has full rights of state file..
--> state file terraform kasame pani chestundhi....

		=====================================================================
							  SES-32-c4
						   *****************
Remote state
==============
--> We should secure state file from accidental changes.  --> it means unfortunately keys press avavtum and delete avvatum with our interruption  .  
---> what is the solution while multiple persons are work chestunte ----> simple solu is centralised state or block or room

we must keep state file in remote location while working in collaboration environment for security and preventing duplicate resources and errors, when multiple members( team members) are working together

--> state file should be locked when terraform is doing something, so for that others can't apply the changes.

--> drive lo manam ela folder create chetamo ala aws lo s3 bucket create cheyali.. for starage purpose our state file....
--> here entire aws s3 bucket name should be unique ga vundali...

--> dsoaws-remote-state --> s3 bucket create chesam next aa file location or path access terraform ki ichhi state files ni akkada store chesuko ani cheppali...

Syntax
-======

backend "s3" { # backend ante remote store ani anukovali
    bucket = "dsoaws-remote-state"
    key    = "remote-state-demo" # so here keys must be not for the same for all, u have to set name as per the requirement like dev ithe dev name and prod ithe prod name 
    region = "us-east-1"
    use_lockfile = true
    encrypt = true --> it means unauthorised person file tisukuna no use bcz data has been encrypt....

---> these are available in provider.tf file 
--> if u a done any changes in provider.tf file then immediately give cmd like (terraform init -reconfigure )

locals
=======
--> so here variable.tf file access andhariki ivvakudadhu or else small company run chestunte vallu as per the budget vallu t3.micro ni use chestaru manam variable.tf file ki access iste  team vallu dhani change chesi use chesukuntaru so we aren't give access to them.. for that we need to create local.tf for restrict purpose..

--> local.tf introduced by  terraform so we can't do any changes.. inside file.

locals are like variables but it has many extra capabilities

1. variables can be overridden, locals can't be overridden ( re-write by someone)
2. we can use variables inside locals. but we can't use one variable in another variable

SYNTAX:
===========
variable "common_name" {
    default = "${var.project}-${var.environment}"
}
3. you can store expressions or functions inside locals block and reuse them whenever required

dynamic block ----> not much use in real time we need to know basic matter about that
==============
loops inside terraform
	count based
	for_each
	dynamic
SYNTAX:
===========
dynamic "setting" {
    for_each = var.settings
    content {
      namespace = setting.value["namespace"]
      name = setting.value["name"]
      value = setting.value["value"]
    }
  }

--> oka block multiple times repeated avuthunte we need to use dynamic......

Provisioners
============
usually terraform is creating instance, if we want to configure terraform is allowing to run few scripts
--> basically provisioning means it will change position to another position... 
We have to options like as below
1. local-exec ---> Simply terraform commands ekkada ithe vundho or run cheestunte  adi local
SYNTAX:
=======
provisioner "local-exec"{
      command = "echo ${self.private_ip} > inventory"
      #on_failure = continue  ---> it means continuing when we resources failed as well

    }
on_failure = continue  it is use like oka vela ip address inventory file lo rayalekapothe provisioner ila cheptundhi the above ec2 resource also failed ni.. so to overcome this issue u need to add on_fail ane option ni add cheste  then provision says like ec2 resources no fail......

 provisioner "local-exec"{
      command = "echo Instance is destroyed"
      when    = destroy   ---> it means destroy time lo kuda run avuthundhi or else creation time lo kuda run avuthundhi....
    }
--> Destroy ani ivvaka pothe adhi by default creation time anukoni manaki print avuthundhi....

2. remote-exec ---> so here local tho server or ec2 instance crate chesi serve loki login ayyi akkada some commands or actions perform excute chese dhani remote exce antam

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yaml ----> ila ansible ki connect cheyachu for server configuration ki

OVER VIEW
=================================================================================

Terraform
===========
setup
variables
data types
conditions -> expression ? "true-value": "false-value"
loops
	count based -> list ki use chestam
	for each -> set/map ki use chestam
	dynamic block
functions -> in built functions

data sources -> query the existing info from provider
locals -> store expressions, functions. we can reuse them. cant override these values. we can variables inside locals
state -> matching desired infra with actual infra using state
remote state -> keep the state secure, for collaboration as well. locking it
provisioners -> when we create ec2 instances we can use provisioners to configure or perform next actions

=====================================================================
							  SES-33-c5
						   *****************

remote-exec
=============
terraform can connect to ec2 instance and configure it using remote-exec. basically running commands inside the server

SYNTAX:
=======
provisioner "remote-exec" { # this is for server creation code
      inline = [
 ## VSCODE
              ]
    }
provisioner "remote-exec" { # this is for server stopping code
      inline = [
 ## VSCODE
              ]
      when = destroy
    }

How to create multiple environments using terraform
===================================================
--> in terraform one of the best example enti ante.. consistent the infrastructure across the environ.. it means if u are in dev or prod or QA lo vunna we can do to create same infrastructure bcz here code is same

1. using .tfvars
2. terraform workspaces
3. individual repos

tfvars
========
it is used to override the default values of the variables
--> so in terraform keys are fixed, so then only changed the values only as per the env or DEV or PROD ... values ni control cheyatame inka
--> main advtage is code reused

Terraform Workspace
=====================
--> Env is nothing but workspace
--> if u a done any changes in provider.tf file then immediately give cmd like (terraform init -reconfigure )

-- >how to get a key in a map in terraform........... https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/lookup
Syntax:
=======
lookup(<map>, <key>, <default_value>)

The Terraform lookup function retrieves a single value from a map variable (a collection of key-value pairs) given a specific key. It allows for dynamic configuration and helps maintain clean, reusable code. 



maintain different repos for different environments
================================
--> here individual ga env wise repos ni create chesukoni code rasukunte better.. bcz to over come issue 
--> but here code anedhi repeated ga avuthundhi..
