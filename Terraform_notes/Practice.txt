session 8 for ip


1. vpc creation has been done like select cidr range and submit vpc name is sri
after VPC creation VPC, dhaniki network ravali so dhani kosam IG ni create cheyali ---> just name and submit
2. created IG and needs to be attach to VPC in action tab click and see attach VPC option then select vpc whichever we created like name is sri
3. 2 subnet created under sri vpc name like pub and pvt here subnet range will under VPC

4 1 route table created for public and needs to attach to pub subnet, in route table tab go to subnetassociation click on edit subnet association select pub subnets 1a 1b 
5 1 route table created for pvt and needs to attach to pvt subnet, in route table tab go to subnetassociation click on edit subnet association select pvt subnets 1a 1b

 --> in route table go to routes tab click on edit routes --> there destination is 0.0.0.0/0 and target internet gateway- igw   --->submit 
6. so pub rt connect avvalante we need to attach ig for pub rt.. pub rt connect avvalante through ig thone

7. elastic ip ni add chesukovali assume like broker
8. nat gateway created and selected elastic ip for creation process --> pub lo nat gateway vunttadhi so select pub subnet while creating nat


-->in route table go to routes tab click on edit routes --> there destination is 0.0.0.0/0 and target NAT gateway- nat --> submit 
9. pvt rt ki nat gateway ni add cheyali bcz for network connections kosam


T-c7-36 session lo vpc creation
-----------------------------------
1. vpc module folder created--> vpc.tf file created in that VPC code will help to create VPC resources--> variable.tf file done it will helps to declare the values
2. locals.tf done it will helps to over the override values for tags name
2a. output.tf file done it will helps to get vpc id .. ikkada vachina vpc id vpc module folder lo store avuthudhi, 

3. vpc module test folder done--> put it in that .gitignore and provider.tf--> main.tf file done it will helps take code and ouputs from vpc module folder
4. variable.tf it will helps to user for give values as per their requirement.. nenu rasina code lo values change chesukovadanki...
5. output.tf file done module folder store ayina output ni main.tf lo access chesam so akkada nuchi manam vpc id tisukovali...

run terraform CMDS as well like init,plan,apply 

6. module folder lo vpc.tf file lo IGW code rasi and vpc_id lo vpc ni attach chesi run chesam
7. separate ga tags kuda rasam like igw_tags ani...

8. module folder lo vpc.tf file lo subnets code rasam
