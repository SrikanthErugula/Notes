1. Tfvars
2. Workspaces
3. Different repos

same code for all environments, code re use --- these are adv
whatever code is written it may be accidentally applied into PROD ---> these are dis-adv

uses for different repos
=====
clear isloation b/w environments, no accidental changes
code should be duplicated -> disadvantage

*** Modules development ***
========
-->Here everything is DRY
-->module.diag prsentted
--> common code antha oka chota vunttadhi, that is called MODULES
if separate code for each component, there is no single point of control

scb -> top level project
savings banking  --> this is a component
current banking --> this is a component so ala same for below
mobile banking --> 
whatsapp banking --> 
demat 
loans 


1. if there is version need to change so then, we need to update in all components ..assume like that we have 10000 components so here difficult to change for all 10000
2. there are no common standards for all the projects, means same code use cheyaru ..
3. maintanance and update is very tough

--> see in google doc 

module advantages
=================
1. changes at single place cascade to all components using that module -> centralised approach--> also called platform engineering..
--> oka org ki rase code ni called as platform engineering..
2. we can implement industry best standards in the module, all other components are forced to use. better for governance, compliance and auditing
3. code reuse

module developers --> whoever developing module we will called as 
module users

--> parameterised cheyatum ante variables laga create cheyatame...users ki chance ivvali values ni update cheyadaniki.

terraform naming convention time is 26:30 min
===========================
sivakumar_reddy_m -> for programs understand --> whichever could see for program or computer we need to use _(underscore)

sivakumar-reddy-m -> for humans understand --> whichever could see for humans we need to use -(iphen)

human Srikanth --> no need to call like these
Srikanth --> ila kuda call chesina fine 
--> for EX: https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming --> here see in ex as well for better understand

catalogue-instance -> resource type name should not be used in resource names lo 
id -> string
ids -> list
--> so here terraform-aws lo vunna ec2.tf file reffer cheyali in roboshop-test file lo ec2.tf ani create chesi...

--> syntax is below
-------------------------
module "module-name" {

	source = ""
	mandatory-variables
}

--> terraform init anedhi provider lo emaina changes chesina and ec2.tf lo changes chesina we have to re run

---> instance_type ni manam control cheyali bcz if we use large t3 type we will loose many budget 
validation {
    condition     = contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "Please select either t3 micro or small or medium"
  }

--> terraform-aws-module code rasetappudu we assume like max values ni parameterised chese laga vundali and default value kuda pettali
--> use chesetappudu u can see roboshop-ec2-test file vally rasina code ni source lo refer cheyali
--> andhulo avi mandatory anni istam like ami_id and instance-type ala next output chusi manaki nachhina value tisukovadame
