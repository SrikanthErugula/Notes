variables
data types
conditions
loops

--> for excute cmd is ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini 17-file_name
functions
=========== see in final notes in last 

--> so here ansible discovered with python code so 
we can write functions but we need to write python code.. not a mandatory for that custom type functions

we can use default in built functions from ansible
Ex: see 18th file for default function 

Transforming strings into lists
----------------------------------
DevOps, Linux, Shell, Ansible -> String
(,)-->  idhi devide chese item above name ni

DevOps
Linux
Shell
Ansible
------ here more ex in 18.1... 18.4 files manaki kavasinattug filter chestunnai

gather_facts --> we know the o/p of this execute whenever we call required data

facts == variables both are same in ansible

18.5 file describe about set_fact see in there it used to define variables

 student_yaml: "" # here lookup anedhi student.yaml file ni capture chesi andhulo lo vunde data ni  from_yaml ante stundet_yaml file lo ki vellu ani cheptunam

msg: "json is :{{ --> here student_yaml lo data  ani to_json means json loki convert chei ani cheptunam.. so its printed but it doesn't good for look or understand to see

u can check with that name like vim student-data1.json.............

18.6 used to know lower and upper case stings conversations

 # IP address filters  --> 18.7 file u can refer there 
255.255.255.255

345.4329.43209.4332

shell vs command :- 19 file done refer there 
================
see in FINAL notes

ansible -> node --> here ansible is calling the server

module lenappudu cmd  tho call cheyali 

here ansible is working like as remote login -> take login, execute command and come out

or login inside the server and execute the command and come out 

see in FINAL notes..... for detailed.....

VAR_NAME=$(command)  --> in shell cmd excute ayyi key lo save avuhundhi...

 ls -ltr > /tmp/output.txt  it means ls -ltr lo data ni /tmp folder ki vellu ani cheptunam

1. we can handle
2. we can't handle

Ex: creating the user but user already exist in this case we need to handle this case 

id roboshop -> open chesi id check chesi chudali 

--> anisible lo error vaste procced avvadhu usually... but in shell lo procced avuthundhi 

    ignore_errors: true  error vastundhi telusu but procced avvalante u can this cmd

Roboshop using Ansible
======================

first we need to run AWS configure before going to start
need to install $ pip3.9 install boto3 botocore

 :- anisible-robo folder lo 01-ec2- file u can refer for ec2 and route 53 record 
Instances creation

1. create instance
2. update r53 record private ip if not frontend, if frontend updated public ip

first aws configure cheyali while excute time 

loop: "{{ ec2_output.results }}" here loop loki  ec2_output indhulo results lo vunde data lo pub and pvt kavali ani cheptunam value lo code rsam { item.instances[0 ila
