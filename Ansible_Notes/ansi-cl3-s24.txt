variables
data types
conditions
loops

--> for excute cmd is ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini 17-file_name
functions
===========
taking input and providing the output, execute whenever we call ---->  so that is called as functions

functions == filters # In ansible we called as filters so both are same
--> so here ansible discovered with python code so 
we can write functions but we need to write python code.. not a mandatory for that custom type functions

we can use default in built functions from ansible
Ex: see 18th file for default function 

Transforming strings into lists
----------------------------------
DevOps, Linux, Shell, Ansible -> String
(,)-->  idhi devide chese item above name ni

DevOps
Linux
Shell
Ansible
------ here more ex in 18.1... 18.4 files manaki kavasinattug filter chestunnai

gather_facts --> we know the o/p of this execute whenever we call required data

facts == variables both are same in ansible

18.5 file describe about set_fact see in there it used to define variables

 student_yaml: "" # here lookup anedhi student.yaml file ni capture chesi andhulo lo vunde data ni  from_yaml ante stundet_yaml file lo ki vellu ani cheptunam

msg: "json is :{{ --> here student_yaml lo data  ani to_json means json loki convert chei ani cheptunam.. so its printed but it doesn't good for look or understand to see

u can check with that name like vim student-data1.json.............

18.6 used to know lower and upper case stings conversations

 # IP address filters  --> 18.7 file u can refer there 
255.255.255.255

345.4329.43209.4332

shell vs command
================
---> linux lo 100% work ayyedi shell and Linux cmd only
so ansible anedhi only process ni easy chestundi anthe

--> oka vela cmd or modules emi lekapothe u can use shell or cmd mode
when we don't have readymade modules available, we can execute command or shell module



ansible -> node --> here ansible is calling the server

module lenappudu cmd  tho call cheyali 

here ansible is working like as remote login -> take login, execute command and come out

or login inside the server and execute the command and come out

command -> a simple command no need of access to shell environment like variables, bash, piping, etc.. ( for small small cmds excute cheyalante u can go with COMMAND MODE) 
shell Module -> can access variables, pipes, redirections, shell environment, etc. ( for complex or restricted times lo u can use shell

VAR_NAME=$(command)  --> in shell cmd excute ayyi key lo save avuhundhi...

 ls -ltr > /tmp/output.txt  it means ls -ltr lo data ni /tmp folder ki vellu ani cheptunam

1. we can handle
2. we can't handle

Ex: creating the user but user already exist in this case we need to handle this case 

id roboshop -> open chesi ni check chesi chudali 

--> anisible lo error vaste procced avvadhu usually... but in shell lo procced avuthundhi 

    ignore_errors: true  error vastundhi telusu but procced avvalante u can this cmd

Roboshop using Ansible
======================
Instances creation

1. create instance
2. update r53 record private ip if not frontend, if frontend updated public ip


============================ FINAL NOTES =====================
default function --> You can override the default values of these settings in the Ansible configuration file or as an environment variable. 

set_fact --> In Ansible, set_fact is a module used to dynamically create or modify variables (facts) during playbook execution, making them available for subsequent tasks
