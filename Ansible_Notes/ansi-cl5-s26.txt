first we need to run AWS configure before going to start 

need to install $ pip3.9 install boto3 botocore

--> official doc and community modules lenaapudu we have to use shell or command module

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mongodb.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini redis.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mysql.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini rabbitmq.yaml

so ila anni okesari run cheyachhu  for reduce the time

user and cart files has been done
shipping file done 

for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://catalogue.dsoaws.fun:8080/health
for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://user.dsoaws.fun:8080/health
for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://cart.dsoaws.fun:8080/health  ---> ila ani chech chesukovali 

--> in ansible every module has been developed by python so we have to install some required modules

payment file has been done

frontend and config files has been created, 
--> upto here roboshop project has been done

Roles
=======
DRY

variables  here also we are using DRY concept
functions here also we are using DRY  concept --> common ga vunde code or matter antha oka chota pettesi manaki need vunnapudu call cheyachu..

Ansible roles is a proper directory structure of creating playbooks, maintaining and reusing. roles will have tasks, files, vars, defaults, handlers, templates. By default role will try to load main.yaml in each directory

SYNTAX : https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

ansible-playbook -i inventory all-start-code.yaml -e "component=redis"
 
============== Google  diff =+===============
Ansible roles are the primary mechanism for organizing and reusing Ansible automation code. They are self-contained, portable units that group related tasks, variables, files, handlers, and templates into a known, standardized directory structure, making complex automation cleaner and easier to manage.  
=================
ansible-robo-roles folder has been done
copied .ini folder
separate ga mongodb.yaml file created
--> manaki kavalisinavi anni roles anifolder create chesi andhulo put cheyali

create roles directoy created
inside roles created mongodb folder--> tasks folder created--> main.yaml
===============================================
next separate ga redis folder directory created 

--> roles: ila iste roles folder loki veli andhulo mongodb file chusi andhulo vunde tasks excute chei ani cheptunam

-> by default anni folders lo vunna main.yaml file ni load chestundhi ani chepparu 

--> next files kosam separate ga one folder that is under  roles folder --> then eni files ithe vunnayo avvani excute avuthai

--> roles lo vunde mongodb directory or folder  lo enni ithe main.yaml files vunnayo avvvani run avuthai and next files folder lo vunde files anniexcute avuthai

--> Redis directory created --> tasks folder created--> main.yaml in this Redis code 
--> avasarum ithe ne amanki kavalisna files create chesukuntamu, like files or taks or templates or handlers ala

--> MySQL directory created --> tasks folder created --> main.yaml file created inside that MySQL code

--> RabbitMQ directory created --> tasks folder created --> main.yaml file created inside that rabbitmq code

--> roles means manam rase playbook li oka proper structure follow avvuthu oka format lo rase process ni roles



============================== FINAL NOTES =======================

ROLES
=======
Ansible roles is a proper directory structure of creating playbooks, maintaining and reusing. roles will have tasks, files, vars, defaults, handlers, templates. By default role will try to load main.yaml in each directory

ansible-playbook -i inventory all-start-code.yaml -e "component=redis"

---> so here why we are using this Pip3 libraries bcz in linix and shell we are using directly but in ansible we are using module to excute lines ... so all modules anni python develop chesaru so python laga vatini install cheyali
