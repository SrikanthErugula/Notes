first we need to run AWS configure before going to start 

need to install $ pip3.9 install boto3 botocore

--> official doc and community modules lenaapudu we have to use shell or command module

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mongodb.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini redis.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mysql.yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini rabbitmq.yaml

so ila anni okesari run cheyachhu  for reduce the time

user and cart files has been done
shipping file done 

for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://catalogue.dsoaws.fun:8080/health
for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://user.dsoaws.fun:8080/health
for checking status netstat -lntp and curl http://cart.dsoaws.fun:8080/health  ---> ila ani chech chesukovali 

--> in ansible every module has been developed by python so we have to install some required modules

payment file has been done
frontend and config files has been created, 
--> upto here roboshop project has been done 

Roles
=======
DRY

variables  here also we are using DRY
functions here also we are using DRY

Ansible roles is a proper directory structure of creating playbooks, maintaining and reusing. roles will have tasks, files, vars, defaults, handlers, templates. By default role will try to load main.yaml in each directory

============== Google  diff =+===============
Ansible roles are the primary mechanism for organizing and reusing Ansible automation code. They are self-contained, portable units that group related tasks, variables, files, handlers, and templates into a known, standardized directory structure, making complex automation cleaner and easier to manage.  
=================
ansible-robo-roles folder has been done
copied .ini folder
separate ga mongodb.yaml file created
create roles folder
inside that mongodb
tasks
redis

--> roles: ila iste roles folder loki veli andhulo mongodb file chusi andhulo vunde tasks excute chei ani cheptunam

-> by default anni folders lo vunna main.yaml file ni load chestundhi ani chepparu 

--> roles lo vunde mongodb folder enni ithe main.yaml files vunnayo avvvani run avuthai and next files folder lo vunde files anniexcute avuthai

--> roles means manam rase playbook li oka proper structure follow avvuthu oka format lo rase process ni roles




---> so here why we are using this Pip3 libraries bcz in linix and shell we are using directly but in ansible we are using module to excute lines ... so all modules anni python develop chesaru so python laga vatini install cheyali
