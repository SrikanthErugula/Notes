Disadvantages of shell
========================
1. No error handling
2. OS specific, homogeneous
3. Little complex to understand
4. Not idempotent
5. Complex to handle large number of servers
=============
---> remote login session 22-->2:00 min to 8:00 see if need.. like these (ssh ec2-user@pvtip of another server ) it is also called as interactive login


1. copy the script and dependent files, mongo.repo and mongodb.sh
2. then execute from main server

Configuration management ( EX: new lapi setup) 
========================
server configuration points 
=---------------------
Install few system packages
Installing Programming runtime
Creating folder
Creating system user
Downloading the code
Unzipping the code
Installing Dependencies
Creating systemctl service files
Staring the application

Baseling/Configuring the server is nothing but making it ready to host the application

Deployment means Downtime     ex:- windows update while that time server downtime
===========
1. Stop the application
2. remove the old code
3. Download new code
4. Install dependencies
5. restart the application

Push vs Pull
============
Push -> Ansible is popular, it recently implemented pull too
Pull -> it is used in Chef software

BANG -> HYD ( courier)
==============
DTDC

Polling/Pulling
===============
I go to DTDC everyday and check whether I received courier or not ( mint mint checking)
so here 
1. chef  lo agnet  ni install chetsam node ki and agent ni configuration cheyali like every 30 min ki changes emaina vunte pull chei  ani..
we have dig name cm.dig see in google doc
Event Driven/Push
===============
You carry on work, when you get a courier it will be delivered ( delivery vaste adhe vastundhi )

so here
we have dig name cm.dig  see in google doc
pulll lo no need to install extra server but u should be monitor  

SYS-1 -> Broadcast
SYS-1 -> SYS-2
we have dig name cm.dig see in google doc
--> Ansible ekkada ithe install ayyi adhi ansible server antaru
---> ansible ekkada ithe connect avuthundho adhi node , boxes, remote , targets antaru  

Linux command == Ansible Module/Collection/tasks

Sample code is in google doc ansible_exe page
------------------------------------------------------------------

dnf install nginx -y
--> dnf is a command
--> install and nginx -> arguments

see in code in google doc ansible_exe page

---> here it is nothing but systemctl start nginx and enable nginx services 
---> u can check in browser with node  ec2 instance of  pub ip 
=---------------------------------------------------------------------
keep all the commands in a file, we call it as shell and run the script  --> its in script

Playbook -> collections of plays, a play is a list of tasks to be executed on the target server

{
	"name": "siva",
	"email": "siva@gmail.com" 
	"password": "siva123"
}

DTO -> Data transfer objects --> data ni oka format/order/sequence/one by one/ lo arrange cheyatame is called DTO bcz for understand to everyone
=======
XML JSON YAML

100 year back go to bank
====================

name
acc no
amount
branch
date
sign

1. Easy to do mistakes
2. Time consuming

Forms == Templates==now this time
=====
Name
Acc No
Date
Amount
Sign

XML -> Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
================================
<Name>Sivakumar</Name>

HTML -> Hyper text markup language
<h1>This is main heading</h1>
<h2>This is side heading</h2>
ex ga student deatils tisukunte  in HTML way lo
xml anedhi old  days lo use chesevallu

 JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation
 ------------------------------------------------------------
YAML -> Yet another markup language
it means list of objects 

for more examples see in ansible folder--> file names are .. student.xml,student.json, student.yaml

---> so here key lo no spaces 
--> values lo vundachu within "" lo

indentation -> spacing

https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/index.html ---> for doc 

#{The ansible.builtin.ping module is a core Ansible module used to test the connectivity and 
    #basic functionality between the Ansible control node and the managed hosts. It is a fundamental tool for verifying that#Ansible can successfully communicate with and execute commands on remote systems. }


in this we learn basic code see in below file
=======================
01-playbook.yaml 
02-nginx.yaml

inventory.ini

--> first need to install anisble server
aws configurartion
pynthon server install
