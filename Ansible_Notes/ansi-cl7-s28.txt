we have to create one ec2 server and then connect to mobaxterm... install ansible

first we need to run AWS configure before going to start 

need to install $ pip3.9 install boto3 botocore

--> for sure every tool has some kind of default configuration or else for customization purpose, so in that if any need we have a chance to edit or recorrect

EX Nginx configuration, crontab config, ssh config.......etc so like that ansible also have some configuration 

ansible configuration
====================
For more deatils u can access the below URL
https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order: --> so ansible will start to search for config any one of it

	1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)

	2. ansible.cfg (in the current directory)

	3. ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)

	4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found, all others are ignored.

--> see google doc for more info cmds

1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG env variable
2. pwd
3. home directory
4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

--> so best preference is 2. pwd, bcz we have been to create many ansible repos, so when that time if u want store specific config for each repos then u will able to create separate folder like ansible.cfg....in your project

--> so in that folder it has many options so reffer this URL for more options to know (https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html)

--> IN ansible-robo-roles --> ansible.cfg folder created

--> see in google for execution 

--> IN ansible.cfg lo log path has been defined 

--> it used to store the all ansible repos logs inside

logs --> need to ask someone session 28 15: 00 min

--> WHAT is DEBUG === VVV measns verbose ======	
=========
Debug is a process used by developers and programmers to identify and remove errors or bugs in software or hardware
--> if u want see excute code ion screen u can give like (-vv) it is for few matter, for more more u can give like (-vvv) 

EX: ]$ ansible-playbook -vv all-start-code.yaml -e "component=mongodb"

TAGS
=====
Ansible tags are metadata used to label tasks, blocks, plays, or roles within a playbook, allowing users to selectively run or skip specific parts during execution. This is particularly useful for debugging, testing, and managing large, complex playbooks

							OR  https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_tags.html

If you have a large playbook, it may be useful to run only specific parts of it instead of running the entire playbook. 

--> means which code excute avvali and adhi excute avakudadhu ani cheptundi..

--> for example deployment chestunam anuko then first time run cheste code antha excute avuthudi, and emaina chages vunte malli first nuchi kakunda only ekkada ithe changes done aa step lu run ithe chalu so run kavalisina step dhaggar tags use cheste done inka

EX : see in cata --> tasks ( main.yaml)  # tags:
  					    # - deployment

--> In execution time u can call it like these ]$ ansible-playbook -vv all-start-code.yaml -e "component=mongodb" -t deployment

--> if need in your projects u can create separate folder in tasks --> main.yaml file andhulo code ni put chei

include_role vs import_role

include_role 					explicit --> crystal clear or obvious or clear
==============          			
it includes at run time, checks while processing. include will not respect tags. We must explicitly set inside the tasks

-->excute time lo overall code antha check chesukodhuu, step by step code excute avuthunte, ekkada ithe step lo fail avuthundho aa step varaku run ayyi agipothundhi

import_role  
==============
imports the role before exection and parse it, checks before processing. applying tags at the import setup to all the tasks automatically.

--> excute time lo overall code antha check chesukoni  emaina error vunte startinglone error vastundhi will stop excution 

--> In ansible-robo-role --> include-import-robo.yaml

--> In roles --> inlcude-imoprt dir --> tasks --> main.yaml
---> In roles --> for-common --> include-import-com.yaml
====================	=======================================================			=================================

dynamic inventory
===============
Dynamic inventory in Ansible automatically fetches a real-time list of hosts from external sources like cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) or CMDBs, eliminating manual updates and adapting to changing infrastructure (like auto-scaled servers)

--> autoscaling means ---> when trafic increase servers will be increased  [ EX: big billon days) 

--> a plugin is provided by aws and ansible to fetch the IP address dynamically 

--> Now let's assume if u have created 6 server in ec2 server in AWS, when if u want take ip of those 6 server easy, but if it has 100 servers when that its very stuff to get 100 ip's

EX: query aws properties or parameters like as us-east-1, ec2, running and name should be frontend  so ila filter chesi query cheyachu through plugins

-->tasks behaviour is -> execute something on the remote/target server  

so manam vere system loki velli info ni fetch cheyalante u need plugins

plugins behaviour is -> connects to other system and fetch required information

so naming formate is demo.aws_ec2.yml/yaml --> instead of demo u can put anything

************for excute CMD --$ ansible-inventory -i demo-plugins.aws_ec2.yaml --graph

--> ila iste demo yaml file excute ayyi ip address lu print avuthai

so now try with this for real time 

--> In ansible-robo-role --> demo-plugins.aws_ec2.yaml file created 

 --> In ansible-robo-rol --> nginx.yaml file created for running u need give below cmd

ansible-inventory -i demo-plugins.aws_ec2.yaml -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 nginx.yaml

--[ansible can connect to AWS dynamically to fetch the IP address using dynamic inventory plugin(amazon.aws.aws_ec2), this helps in autoscaling kind of environment, where fetching the IP address statically is not possible]



secrets
==========
we have one parameter vault means-> secured place to keep the secrets

in ansible we have called =---> ansible-vault

ansible-vault create vault.yaml

secrets manager
===============
AWS is a platform

hashicorp vault

store key inside the server
